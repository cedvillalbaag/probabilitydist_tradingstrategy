Probability Distribution - Trading Strategy

Probability distributions have a fundamental and critical impact on a stock's trading strategy. Not only do they help understand an asset's past performance, but they are also crucial for risk management and making informed decisions about the future.

Here are the main impacts:

1. Quantifying Risk and Return
Understanding variability: A probability distribution (such as Normal, Log-Normal, or Student's t) can model a stock's returns. This allows traders to understand not only the expected return (mean of the distribution), but also the volatility (standard deviation) and the possibility of extreme events (tails of the distribution).

Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR): Probability distributions are the basis for calculating risk metrics such as VaR and CVaR.

VaR: Tells you the maximum loss you can expect with a certain level of confidence over a given period of time (e.g., 95% confidence that you won't lose more than $X in a day).

CVaR: Goes a step further and tells you the expected loss given that the loss exceeds the VaR. This is crucial for understanding "tail" risk or extreme events.

Portfolio Optimization: By understanding the return distributions of multiple stocks, traders can use portfolio optimization techniques (such as Markowitz optimization) to find the asset allocation that maximizes return for a given level of risk, or minimizes risk for a desired return.

2. Evidence-Based Decision-Making
Probability of Success: By modeling the possible outcomes of a trade, you can estimate the probability of a trade being profitable or reaching a specific price target. This allows the trader to evaluate a strategy's "mathematical expectation" (average expected profit per trade). A strategy can be profitable even if its success rate is less than 50%, as long as the average profit significantly exceeds the average loss.

Defining Stop-Loss and Take-Profit: Distributions can help you set stop-loss and take-profit levels more intelligently. For example, a stop-loss could be placed at a point where the probability of the price falling beyond that level is very low according to historical or projected distributions.

Anomaly Identification: If a stock's price behavior deviates significantly from what its expected probability distribution predicts, this could be a signal to investigate the cause or adjust the strategy.

3. Probabilistic Forecasting
Beyond a single prediction: Instead of just predicting a future price (point prediction), probability distributions allow for probabilistic forecasting. This means you can predict a range of future prices and assign a probability to each outcome within that range.

Scenarios: Allows the creation of scenarios (best case, worst case, most likely case) and the assignment of probabilities to each, which is invaluable for contingency planning.

4. Backtesting and Strategy Optimization
Strategy Robustness: When testing a trading strategy with historical data, analyzing the distribution of results (profits and losses) allows you to assess the strategy's robustness. Is it consistently profitable? Does it suffer from large drawdowns?

Parameter Tuning: Distributions can help optimize a strategy's parameters (e.g., the number of periods for a moving average) by analyzing how different parameters affect the distribution of returns.

5. Types of Relevant Distributions in Finance
Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: Often used as a starting point for modeling asset returns, although actual returns are known to have "fat tails" (more extreme events than a normal distribution predicts).

Log-Normal Distribution: Commonly used to model asset prices, since prices cannot be negative and their returns are usually multiplicative. If log-returns are normal, prices are log-normal.

Student's t Distribution: Useful for capturing the "fat tails" or leptokurtosis observed in financial returns, meaning it assigns a higher probability to extreme events than a normal distribution would.

Binomial Distribution: Can be used to model discrete outcomes, such as the probability of a price rising or falling in the next period, or the success/failure of a trade.

Other distributions: There are many others, such as Pareto distributions (for tail events), LÃ©vy distributions (for processes with jumps), etc., which may be more appropriate for certain aspects of market behavior.
